        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
            1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
            desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            Why do we use it?

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                     and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also

                    Why do we use it?
                    
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
                    their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
                    their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
                    on purpose (injected humour and the like).
