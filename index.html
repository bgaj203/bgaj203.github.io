                    I was only 19 years old when I moved to New Zealand in the pursuit of a fuller 
                    life. While studying, I worked a range of part-time jobs to gain experience. 
                    These jobs were fun and entertaining, plus paid the bills. Entering the workforce 
                    as an Estimator and designer, I soon realised there are some gaps between what 
                    is taught and what happens in the industry. So, I immersed myself within the 
                    industry and the work to gain the skill I need to progress. Within the first 
                    two and a half years, I rose into the position of senior estimator and designer 
                    and had my own assistant working for me and learning from me. This was when I 
                    had my <b>big realisation</b>.

                    When I started managing people, I came to realise that if I am to dedicate myself 
                    to an industry, I would instead immerse myself in the tech industry. This is 
                    something I was passionate about since I was a kid. I have spent most of my free 
                    time learning about programming languages and how AI, ML, and advances in modern 
                    computing have influenced our daily lives. I thought to myself, “Hey, why don’t I 
                    learn more about this and start working in the tech industry. I know I will fit 
                    perfectly into the industry, and it will be the perfect career for me". So now comes 
                    <b>the new beginning</b>.

                    In 2017 I had a plan. I had the burning desire to go back to studies. So, I had a 
                    chat with my manager. He was very understanding, and I got his full support. I 
                    handed in my 8 weeks’ notice and enrolled at the University of Auckland to do a 
                    Bachelors’ degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I haven’t looked

                    For me, this is my stress reliever. There is nothing more calming 
                    than going into nature or even into the heart of a city and taking 
                    y time to take the best possible photograph I can imagine. 
                    <br> <br>The process of editing is so soothing and always helps me 
                    to think creatively. How can I make this photo even better? How can 
                    bring these colours to pop without making my eyes hurt? <br> <br>
                    It never 
                    hurt to exercise my creative muscle. Processes involved in 
                    photography have taught me many things, and now creativity is 
                    something I value in myself.

                    At first, I started this to increase my strength and body weight. 
                    Overtime training has turned into my favourite activity for 
                    stress reduction and my mental strength. Over the years of my 
                    training, this helped me build many of my current values. I learnt 
                    the importance of consistency, perseverance and hard work. <br><br>
                    Waking up at 4 am to go to the gym require an enormous amount of 
                    discipline and mental endurance. But I still do it because nothing 
                    builds my mind and body like a good training session first thing in 
                    the morning.
