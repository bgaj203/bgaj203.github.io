                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
                        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                        1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
                        desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                        Why do we use it?
                        
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
                        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
                        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
                        on purpose (injected humour and the like).
