        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
            1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
            desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            Why do we use it?

                    I was only 19 years old when I moved to New Zealand in a pursuit of a fuller life. 
                    Just like any other international student, I completed my education in 2013 and 
                    entered the New Zealand workforce. During my studies, I did a few different part-time 
                    jobs to prove myself that I can handle any form of work( can be rewritten , 
                    maybe something like While studying , I worked a range of part time jobs to gain experience , 
                    something along those lines ). These jobs were fun and entertaining, plus paid the bills. 
                    Entering the New Zealand workforce as an Estimator and designer I soon realised there are 
                    some gaps between what is taught and what happens in the industry was a huge eye-opener. 
                    So, I jumped into the deep end and learnt everything there is to learn (re write this sentence, 
                    something like I immersed myself within the industry and the work gaining new skills that 
                    I progressed from …. something along those lines) . Within the first two and a half years,
                     I rose into the position of ( actual position name ?)management and had my own 
                     assistant working for me and learning from me. This is when I had my big realising moment.

                    When I started working as a manager, I came to realise I had more to offer in the 
                    New Zealand workforce and that I do not fit well into the industry I was in.
                    ( I came to realise that if I was the spend my time and dedicate myself to an industry, 
                    I would rather immerse myself into technology, a long time passion of mine , that I was 
                    passionate about since I was young ) I am more passionate about technology and how things 
                    come together. I have spent most of my free time learning about programming languages and 
                    how AI, ML, and advances in modern computing have influenced our daily lives as individuals 
                    and corporations. I thought to myself, “Hey, why don’t I learn more about this and start 
                    working in the tech industry. I know I will fit perfectly into the industry. After all, 
                    this will not be just a career. It is me combining my passion projects and converting it 
                    into a career.” So now comes the new beginning.

                    In 2017 I had a plan. I had the burning desire to go back to studies. So, I had a 
                    chat with my manager. He was very understanding, and I got his full support. 
                    I handed in my 8 weeks’ notice and enrolled at the University of Auckland to do a 
                    Bachelors’ degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I haven’t looked back since.
