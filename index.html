                    I was only 19 years old when I moved to New Zealand in the pursuit of a fuller 
                    life. While studying, I worked a range of part-time jobs to gain experience. 
                    These jobs were fun and entertaining, plus paid the bills. Entering the workforce 
                    as an Estimator and designer, I soon realised there are some gaps between what 
                    is taught and what happens in the industry. So, I immersed myself within the 
                    industry and the work to gain the skill I need to progress. Within the first 
                    two and a half years, I rose into the position of senior estimator and designer 
                    and had my own assistant working for me and learning from me. This was when I 
                    had my <b>big realisation</b>.
                </p>
            </div>    
        </div>

        <div class="aboutMeCard">
            <strong class="contentTitle" id="contentTitle">Big Realisation</strong>
            
            <div class="aboutMeImage">

            <div id="aboutMeData">

                    When I started managing people, I came to realise that if I am to dedicate myself 
                    to an industry, I would instead immerse myself in the tech industry. This is 
                    something I was passionate about since I was a kid. I have spent most of my free 
                    time learning about programming languages and how AI, ML, and advances in modern 
                    computing have influenced our daily lives. I thought to myself, “Hey, why don’t I 
                    learn more about this and start working in the tech industry. I know I will fit 
                    perfectly into the industry, and it will be the perfect career for me". So now comes 
                    <b>the new beginning</b>.

                    In 2017 I had a plan. I had the burning desire to go back to studies. So, I had a 
                    chat with my manager. He was very understanding, and I got his full support. I 
                    handed in my 8 weeks’ notice and enrolled at the University of Auckland to do a 
                    Bachelors’ degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I haven’t looked 
                    back since.

                    Living independently taught me many things, and these lessons helped me construct <b>my Values</b>.
